# GL imshow in Python

This repository provides programs to display images in Python via OpenGL. The main purpose is for structured light illumination, particularly for nearly synchronized image capturing in projector-camera or display-camera systems.

The core rendering program is borrowed from [kamino410/gl_imshow](https://github.com/kamino410/gl_imshow) developed by [Takumi Kaminokado](https://kamino410.github.io/). I have modified the original C++ code and bound it to Python using nanobind. I acknowledge and respect his pioneering work.
